# P5.JS ASCII Art
Takes a live feed from your webcam, and generates ASCII art from it.
Allows you to modify a few settings including:
- Whether to render in black and white or with colour.
- How much whitespace should be rendered.
- Whether darker or lighter colours should use denser characters.
- Whether or not to render the webcam capture as well.
